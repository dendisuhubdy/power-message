# Power Message

## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Get Going

First we start our server. This server will control our iMessage client, it allows us to send and recieve iMessages via a simple REST api. 

In this functional demo - both the server and client will be on the same machine, but if your interested in running the server in the cloud so you can access it from anywhere in the world üåé please shoot me an email!

## Relay and REST server
```bash
./relay-server
```

Next we have to turn on our client. This client sends and recieves all of your iMessages. The client looks for the running server and makes a secure websocket connection via openssl generated 509 cert. 

Note: you will have to grant `Full Disk Access` to the `terminal` app since Apple has impelented a new security system that locks down Apple services like Mail, Safari and Messages. **If you do not grant the `terminal` access. power-message will not have permission to read the Messsage database - and the app will not work**

## Message Client
```bash
./message-client
```

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Sending Messages


An example username and password are hardcoded in the demo and you must login with these credentials to get a vaild JWT. We use JWT's to secure the REST api.

```python
pmc = PowerMessageClient(
    host = "http://localhost:8080/", 
    username = "power-message-user", 
    password = "super-secret-password"
)
```

Next we'll check if there are any existing users (since this is our first time, there will be no user so well need to add one!)

```python
pmc.get_all_users()
# {u'rows': []}
```

Lets add our own phone number **IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS NOT LINKED TO THE IMESSAGE ACCOUNT THAT YOUR COMPUTER IS SIGNED INTO**.

In my case - my laptop is logged into my `@icloud` account, and I added a user with my cellphone number (which is not associated with my icloud account).


```python
pmc.add_new_user({
    "name": "David Holtz",
    # "number": "+12345678910"
    "number": ". . . YOUR PHONE NUMBER INCLUDING COUNTRY CODE (eg +1). . .",
    "email": "david.richard.holtz@gmail.com",
    "profileurl": "",
    "instagram": "",
    "facebook": "",
    "linkedin": "",
    "firstname": "david",
    "lastname": "holtz",
})
```

We've succesfully added a new user, when interacting with the REST api we do not send message to RAW phone numbers. We add a user, then send messages to that user. 

In order to get the user id, we'll need to ask for a list of all of the existing users in power-message

```python
pmc.get_all_users()
# {u'rows': [{u'CreatedAt': u'2019-10-28T21:20:28.747819-04:00',
#    u'DeletedAt': None,
#    u'ID': 1,
#    u'UpdatedAt': u'2019-10-28T21:20:28.747819-04:00',
#    u'email': u'david.richard.holtz@gmail.com',
#    u'facebook': u'',
#    u'firstname': u'david',
#    u'instagram': u'',
#    u'lastname': u'holtz',
#    u'linkedin': u'',
#    u'name': u'David Holtz',
#    u'number': u'+12345678910',
#    u'profileurl': u''}]}
```

We can see that the user we just made has an ID of 1. We'll use this to send that user a message!


```python
pmc.send_message("1", "Send a iMessage via REST")
```



# Important notes

Please generate your own keys!

The keys provided in the `keys` are for demonstration purposes only! I suggest using openssl to generate new keys - even for your demo app just to be secure.
